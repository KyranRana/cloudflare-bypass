# cloudflare-bypass
A static PHP library which allows you to bypass the CloudFlare UAM page (Under Attack Mode). 

This script works by converting the JavaScript challenge code into code understood by the PHP compiling engine. 

Documentation will be coming for /v2/ soon. Until then, look in /v2/examples for usage examples.
